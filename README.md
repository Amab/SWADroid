## Contributing

SWADroid is an open source project.  I encourage contributions.

The Github team has also been kind enough to write up some great [documentation][doc_contrib] on working with pull requests. Contributions should be performed on [topic branches][topic_br] in your personal forks - just issue your pull requests from there.
